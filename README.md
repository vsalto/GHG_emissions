GHG Emissions Analysis (1970–2023)
A data-driven initiative focused on understanding global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trends across regions, income groups, and continents. This project contributes valuable insights into emission reduction strategies, offering a comprehensive view of global progress toward sustainability.

🔍 Key Insights:
- Global GHG emissions have doubled since the 1970s, with stabilization in recent years.
EU27 has reduced emissions in the last decade, shrinking its global share from 20% (1970) to <10% (2023).
- High-income countries show a slight decline in per capita emissions, while lower-income groups remain stable.
- Asia dominates global emissions, led by China, while Europe and North America exhibit steady declines.
